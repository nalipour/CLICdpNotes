	the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma
	in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC. It currently includes more
	than 900 physicists and senior engineers, from both nuclear and high-energy
	physics, from about 80 institutions in 28 countries.The experiment
	was approved in February 1997. The detailed design of the different
	detector systems has been laid down in a number of Technical Design
	Reports issued between mid-1998 and the end of 2001 and construction
	has started for most detectors.Since the last comprehensive information
	on detector and physics performance was published in the ALICE Technical
	Proposal in 1996, the detector as well as simulation, reconstruction
	and analysis software have undergone significant development. The
	Physics Performance Report (PPR) will give an updated and comprehensive
	summary of the current status and performance of the various ALICE
	subsystems, including updates to the Technical Design Reports, where
	appropriate, as well as a description of systems which have not been
	published in a Technical Design Report.The PPR will be published
	in two volumes. The current Volume I contains: a short theoretical
	overview and an extensive reference list concerning the physics topics
	of interest to ALICE, relevant experimental conditions at the LHC,
	a short summary and update of the subsystem designs, and a description
	of the offline framework and Monte Carlo generators. Volume II, which
	will be published separately, will contain detailed simulations of
	combined detector performance, event reconstruction, and analysis
	of a representative sample of relevant physics observables from global
	event characteristics to hard processes.},

	a given material (incident E [greater-than or equivalent to] 10 GeV),
	the relative abundance and spectrum of each hadronic species responsible
	for most of the energy deposition is independent of the energy or
	species of the incident hadron, and b) because [pi]0 production bleeds
	off more and more energy into the electromagnetic sector as the energy
	of the incident hadron increases, the absolute level of this low-energy
	hadronic activity (E [less, approximate] 1 GeV) rises less rapidly
	than the incident energy, and in fact rises very nearly as a power
	of the incident energy. Both features are of great importance in
	hadron calorimetry, where it is the "universal spectrum" which makes
	possible the definition of an intrinsic e/h, and the increasing fraction
	of the energy going into [pi]0's which leads to the energy dependence
	of e/[pi]. We present evidence for the "universal spectrum," and
	use an induction argument and simulation results to demonstrate that
	the low-energy activity ss Em, with 0.80 [less, approximate] m [less,
	approximate] 0.85. The hadronic activity produced by incident pions
	is 15-20%% less than that initiated by protons.},

	Calorimeter response is largely determined by the transfer of energy

	production. Fluctuations in this quantity produce the "constant term"
	in hadron calorimeter resolution. The increase of its fractional

	of the [pi]/e ratio in a noncompensating calorimeter. The mean hadronic

	deposits are detected with efficiencies e and h, respectively. If
	the mean fraction of which is deposited as nuclear gamma rays is
	, then the expression becomes . Fluctuations in these quantities,
	along with sampling fluctuations, are incorporated to give an overall
	understanding of resolution, which is different from the usual treatments

	is reached around 25 ppm vol. At large concentrations (> 1000 ppm

	the dopant. The attenuation length of the UV luminescence from liquid
